# Online_Payment_Gateway
This project demonstrates how an online payment gateway works by simulating the flow of a transaction — from entering payment details to receiving confirmation. It highlights security, user experience, and transaction management.- The user enters payment details (card, UPI, net banking, or wallet) on the merchant’s checkout page.If approved,the merchant confirms the order and the customer receives a success message.
- If declined, the customer is asked to retry or use another payment method.
